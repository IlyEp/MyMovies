## Description

Pokedex is a lighthearted web application built using Vue.js with an api we create. The app allows a user to search for various information about Pokemon, and their statistics.

I made a login page and a search bar that allows you to search for any pokemon you want.

There are also users who can log in with a password : Barnab√©, Hippolyte and Jonas
#### Technologies

- Vue.js
